"""graph_store.py — SQLite persistence for durable agent graphs.

The single most important module in the runtime: it holds the *execution state*
that is deliberately separated from the LLM loop. A process can die anywhere
(kill -9, OOM, Ctrl-C, panic) and the run survives, because the run lives in
four SQLite tables — not in Python locals:

    graphs      — DAG *templates* (node defs + edges), authored once
    runs        — one row per trigger fire (an *instance* of a graph)
    nodes       — per-(run, node) state machine: pending→ready→running→done/failed
    executions  — append-only event log (event-sourcing); the audit + replay trail

Durability invariant: every status mutation and its event row are written in
the SAME transaction. There is never a node marked `done` whose `done` event
failed to append — the two commit together or not at all.

Resume protocol: on restart, `recover_run` resets any node left `running`
(claimed by a now-dead worker) back to `ready`. The READY frontier is then
re-derived from the table — `nodes WHERE status='ready'` — never from memory.

(Extracted near-verbatim from agent-prep lab-04-6-durable-runtime; only the
``file_lock`` import was repointed to ``agentkit.runtime.file_lock``.)
