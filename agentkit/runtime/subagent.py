"""agentkit.runtime.subagent — status contract + polling-timeout safety-net.

A parent that spawns an async/background subagent cannot trust the child's
self-reported status forever: a hung child reports ``running`` indefinitely, and
the task's *own* timeout never fires if the child simply lies about being alive.
The fix (deer-flow `subagents/status_contract.py` + `task_tool.py`) is two
independent timers — the task budget, and the *parent's* poll-loop patience —
plus a **closed, enumerated status contract** parsed identically on both sides.

This module is the in-process version: a fixed status vocabulary, a cross-boundary
``parse_status`` (the contract), and ``poll_until_terminal`` which adds the
polling-timeout SAFETY-NET on top of any "ask the child for its status" callable.
